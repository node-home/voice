Grammar revolves around expressions, statements and itents.

Expressions are atomic units of meaning or a combination of expressions.

A statement is a meaningful expression.
An intent is a concept which can be expressed by any number of statements.

Intent is like the shared knowledge between computer and human. A grammar is a tree of expression nodes with statement leaves that link to intents. It also allows the computer to vocalize intent.

Intents can have variables.

In future, we'd like the same statement to have different intent through sentiment. And learning.


What would be nice is a system like captcha for
- sentiment analysis
- natural language learning
